## Inspiration

Social media usage has increased to staggering numbers, making your online presence more present than ever. Over seventy percent of employers use social media screening for new hires, nearly forty percent of couples meet online, and these numbers continue to grow. Revamp has the opportunity to give a second chance, providing more career opportunities, possibilities for connections, and helping others put their best foot forward.

## What it does

Revamp works to enhance it's users' social media presence by screening and analyzing Twitter history. With a click of a button, users are presented with a graphical representation of customized data, suggestions, and specific adjectives to describe their overall impression.

## How we built it

Our early stages of planning included a list of brainstormed features, later condensed and formulated to use with the Agile framework, KanBan, to help us efficiently complete tasks and monitor the status and responsibility of each feature.
 We then created a website wireframe using figma.com as a blueprint. 
Revamp came alive with the programming language Python and a micro web framework, flask, to create our server-side code. Our client-side code was created with the programming language Javascript with an open-source library, React, to create a seamless user interface. Our client-side code included the use of AJAX to provide asynchronous javascript, as well as JavaScript Object Notation to help facilitate storing and transmitting important data objects. Graphical representation was created with the help of d3.js, a JavaScript library, to provide a dynamic visual representation to enhance the user experience. To determine first impression adjectives, we used augmented intelligence with IBM's Watson API.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced many challenges while creating Revamp including the process of determining what is deemed as unprofessional, and how we could algorithmically represent this in our program. When working in a group, it can be difficult to find a group of individuals with the same exact background and experience in specific tech stacks, so many challenges included being unfamiliar with specific tech tools, languages, and frameworks.   

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Accomplishments that we are proud of include our ability to work well with one another, our organizational skills, use of Agile methodology, and ability to adjust using tech tools we're not familiar with. Despite our enhanced technical skills, we have gained the ability to be a better team player, communicator, and strategizer.

## What we learned

Each of us learned different things including new frameworks, the use of augmented intelligence, new libraries, and more. Not only did we learn technical skills, but we also learned new soft skills that are required to be an efficient member of a team like communication, leadership, and compromise. To work as a functional team, we diplomatically chose ideas, gave adequate feedback, and embraced encouraging behavior towards one another.

## What's next for Revamp

The next steps for Revamp are to expand to other social media sites to better help its users with a well-rounded media presence to help them present a great first impression for the purpose of more opportunities professionally and personally.
